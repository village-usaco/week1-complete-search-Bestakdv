This week we start with a problem that requires a solution performing Complete Search (or Brute Force). This means that you will need to consider all possible combinations of some variables to find the solution.

# 🐄 Problem 1: Farthest Pair of Points

In this challenge, you're given `n` points on a 2D plane. Your task is to find the **pair of points that are farthest apart**, and print both their coordinates and the distance between them.

This is a classic brute-force geometry problem that helps you practice nested loops, array handling, and distance calculation.

---

## 📥 Input

The input consists of **three lines**:

1. The first line contains a single integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of points.
2. The second line contains `n` integers — the x-coordinates of the points.
3. The third line contains `n` integers — the y-coordinates of the points.

Each point's coordinates are paired by position — for example, the first point is at `(x[0], y[0])`, the second is at `(x[1], y[1])`, and so on.

## 📤 Output

Print the following:

- The coordinates of the two points that are farthest apart (any one such pair if multiple)
- The **squared distance** between them

---

## 🧪 Example

### Input:
```
4
1 5 3 0
1 2 4 1
```

### Output:
```
Farthest points: (5, 2) and (0, 1)
Squared distance: 26.0
```

### Your Task
Modify the starter code to get the output as shown above.
